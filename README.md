Project : Hangman Game in Python

  This Python project implements the classic Hangman game, where the player tries to guess a secret word one letter at a time. The word is chosen randomly from a predefined list of fruit names, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct word. The program provides visual feedback by displaying placeholders (_) for unguessed letters and revealing the correct letters as they are guessed.


Project : Keylogger Using the pynput Module

 This project implements a basic keylogger using Python's pynput library. A keylogger is a program that captures and logs keyboard events, such as key presses and releases, to a file or console. This project demonstrates how to monitor keyboard input for various purposes like debugging, analytics, or security research.
