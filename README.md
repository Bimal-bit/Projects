Project: Hangman Game in Python

  This Python project implements the classic Hangman game, where the player tries to guess a secret word one letter at a time. The word is chosen randomly from a predefined list of fruit names, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct word. The program provides visual feedback by displaying placeholders (_) for unguessed letters and revealing the correct letters as they are guessed.
